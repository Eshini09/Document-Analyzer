Physical Characteristics and Atmosphere
Saturn's immense size and rapid rotation create a distinctively oblate shape, meaning it is visibly flattened at the poles and bulges at the equator. 
Composition: It is a "gas giant" made of approximately 96.3% hydrogen and 3.25% helium, with trace amounts of methane and ammonia.
Atmospheric Features: The north pole features a unique hexagonal jet stream nearly 20,000 miles wide. Winds at the equator can reach a staggering 1,100 mph (1,800 km/h).
Internal Heat: According to NASA, Saturn radiates 2.5 times more energy into space than it receives from the Sun, likely due to "helium rain" deep in its interior. 
The Ring System
Saturn’s rings are the most extensive in the solar system, spanning up to 175,000 miles (282,000 km) from the planet. 
Material: They are composed of billions of individual chunks of ice and rock, ranging in size from tiny dust grains to house-sized boulders.
Structure: The main rings (A, B, and C) are relatively close together, but are separated by large gaps like the 2,920-mile-wide Cassini Division.
Thickness: Despite their vast width, the main rings are incredibly thin, typically averaging only about 30 feet (10 meters) in vertical height. 
Moons and Exploration
Saturn has a massive "family" of satellites, with over 140 moons confirmed as of recent counts. 
Titan: Saturn's largest moon is bigger than the planet Mercury and is the only moon in the solar system with a substantial atmosphere and liquid hydrocarbon lakes.
Enceladus: This small, icy moon features water-ice plumes spraying from its south pole, leading scientists to believe it may have a subsurface ocean capable of supporting life.
Key Missions: Four robotic spacecraft have visited Saturn: Pioneer 11, Voyager 1, Voyager 2, and the Cassini-Huygens mission, which orbited the planet from 2004 to 2017.
